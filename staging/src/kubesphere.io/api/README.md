# api

Schema of the external API types that are served by the ImagineKube API server.

# Where does it come from?

api is synced from https://github.com/imaginekube/imaginekube/blob/master/staging/src/imaginekube.com/api. Code changes are made in that location, merged into `imaginekube.com/api` and later synced here.
